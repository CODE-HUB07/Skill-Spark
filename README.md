# 🚀 Skills Spark Mentor Hub  
*Empowering Learners, Enabling Mentors – One Skill at a Time.*

---

## 📌 Problem Statement  
**Problem Statement 8 – Reimagine Peer-to-Peer Learning & Mentorship**

---

## 🎯 Objective  
In today’s fast-paced digital world, learners often struggle to find personalized guidance that adapts to their specific goals and learning styles. **SkillsSpark Mentor Hub** solves this by offering a platform where users can directly connect with experienced mentors based on their skill preferences, availability, and growth plans.  
It serves students, self-learners, career switchers, and working professionals who are seeking structured, one-on-one mentorship to elevate their skills and careers.

The platform enables goal-based mentorship matching, real-time learning tracking, and an accessible environment for both mentors and mentees, bridging the gap between skill acquisition and expert guidance.

## 🧠 Team & Approach  
**Team Name:** The_Hackoholics 🚀  

**Team Members:**  
- Siddhant Sharma (Frontend Developer / Project Lead)  
- Varun Sharma  
- Bhavesh Sahu
- Aryan Yadav

**Your Approach:**  
- Chose this problem because we personally experienced the lack of mentorship in technical learning journeys.  
- Aimed to build a clean, interactive solution where mentorship is not just accessible but also scalable.  
- Faced major deployment issues (initially with Netlify), challenges in authentication system, and mentor filtering logic.  
- Overcame hurdles with UI responsiveness, routing, and local API simulations before moving to deployment.  
- Breakthroughs included designing a reusable mentor card component, dynamic filtering, and integrating mentor-hiring logic without a backend using mock data.
